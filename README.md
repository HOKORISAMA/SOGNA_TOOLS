# Some tools to unpack and pack SOGMA game engine files (SGS.dat 1.0)

### Can be used to extract and reinsert text from .WIN files, you can patch the SGS.DAT as well.
### Use main.py then put win files in input_files folder, use main.py -u to extract to json.
### Translate json by writing the translation to trans, then run main.py -r to get new patched files in output_files.
### The tool supports automatic newlines but if you feel the need to add newlines at userdefined places just add a '\n' in line.


## This tool had limited testing and might not work for all games, so if you encounter any issue then report it and I'll try to fix it.
